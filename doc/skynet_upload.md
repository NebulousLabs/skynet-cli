## skynet upload

Upload a file or a directory to Skynet.

### Synopsis

Upload a file or a directory to Skynet. A skylink will be produced
which can be shared and used to retrieve the file. If the given path is
a directory all files under that directory will be uploaded individually and
an individual skylink will be produced for each. All files that get uploaded
will be pinned to Skynet Portal used for the upload, meaning that the portal
will pay for storage and repairs until the files are manually deleted.
