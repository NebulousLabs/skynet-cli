## skynet upload

Upload a file or a directory to Skynet.

### Synopsis

Upload a file or a directory to Skynet. A skylink will be produced which can be
shared and used to retrieve the file. If the given path is a directory all files
under that directory will be uploaded individually and an individual skylink
will be produced for each. All files that get uploaded will be pinned to Skynet
Portal used for the upload, meaning that the portal will pay for storage and
repairs until the files are manually deleted.
